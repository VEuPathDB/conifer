Generate a set of files from templates and a yaml configuration files.

Usage: generateFilesFromTemplates templates_meta_file config_file meta_file

Where:
  templates_meta_file: a tab file with two columns, specifying the templates to insert the values into,
                       and optionally, for each template, where to write the output.
  config_file:         a yaml file that specifies values to substitute into the templates (see below)
  meta_file:           a yaml file that specifies required meta config (see below).


== Templates Meta File ==
The templates meta file contains a list of the templates to generate from, and optionally, for each,
a destination file. It looks like this:

/home/wherever/happy.xml.tmpl
/home/noplace/sad.conf.tmpl ${gus_home}/config/sad.conf

The first column is the name of a template file.  A template file can be any file whatsoever, but
must have a .tmpl extenion.  If it contains macros of the form $[hi_i_am_a_macro_key], then those macros
will be replaced by a value that matches the macro key, as provided by the config_file.  Macro keys
that are not found in the config_file produce an error.

The second column is optional.  If absent the output file for the template will be in the same
directory as the template, and have the same name, minus the .tmpl extension.  If present, the output
will be written to the specified file.

The meta template file is itself a template file:  it may have macros.  The values for these macros
are provided by the 'required:' section of the meta config file (see below).  The subsitution occurs
before the template file names are used to read and write files.


== Config File ==
The config_file is a yaml file that provides keys/values to substitute into the templates.  The meta
config file configure this file, resolving it into a simple set of key value pairs to apply to the templates.

The config_file looks like this:

default: {
 k1: v1
 k2: v2
}

some_section_name: {
 k3: v3
 k4: ${some_macro_name}
}

some_other_section_name: {
 k5: v5
 k6: v6
}

maybe_another_section_name: {
 k7: v7
}

The 'default:' section is required, though may be empty.  It provides default key/value pairs to subsitute into the templates.
The other sections are optional.  They can have arbitrary names, and, like the default section, provide key/values pairs
for substitution into the templates.  Each of these sections is ignored unless it is mentioned in the 'sections:' section of
the meta file (see below).

The config file may contain macros (in that sense it too is a template file).  All macros in the config file
must have key/value pairs mentioned in the 'required:' section of the meta file (see below).


== Meta File ==
The meta_file is used to configure the config_file.  It is a yaml file of this format:

required: {
 key1: value1
 key2: value2
}

sections:
 - section1
 - section2

custom: {
 key3: value3
}

The 'required:' section provides keys and values for macros in the config_file (if any).  The config_file
may contain macros of the form ${someMacroName}.  Each of those macro names must be a key in the
'required:' section, and must have a value to substitute in to the macro.  This substitution
makes the config_file a valid and complete yaml file.

The 'sections:' section contains an ordered list of optional sections to read from the config file.
Any section not mentioned in the 'sections:' section is ignored.  The sections mentioned are unioned
into the growing list of key/value pairs.  The sections are applied in the order listed in the 'sections:'
section, and overrides existing key/value pairs.  Thus the default section has lowest priority, and
the earlier sections in the 'sections:' section have lower priority than those that follow.

The 'custom:' section is optional.  It has the highest priority of all sections, and is used as
an escape hatch to customize the configuration.
